# Benchmark Analysis Report: Atomic Operation Implementations

## Summary

Following a series of optimizations to the "Atomic2" implementation, and fixes for race conditions, this report details the comparative performance characteristics of three distinct code versions: "Original," "Atomic," and "Atomic2." The analysis covers single-write, concurrent-write, query, and mixed workload scenarios. The results demonstrate that the optimized Atomic2 implementation now delivers superior performance in nearly all scenarios, offering significant improvements in execution speed, memory efficiency, and scalability.

## Detailed Analysis

### Single Write Operations

All three implementations now perform comparably in single-write scenarios, with execution times hovering around 298–300 nanoseconds per operation. Memory usage and allocation counts are also nearly identical, indicating that the Atomic2 optimization has eliminated any previous overhead in this scenario.

### Concurrent Write Operations

The Atomic2 implementation stands out as the clear leader in concurrent-write performance, achieving an average execution time of 193.5 ns/op—approximately 21% faster than the Atomic implementation and over twice as fast as the Original. Additionally, Atomic2 demonstrates improved memory efficiency, utilizing only 260 bytes per operation.

### Query Operations

While all implementations exhibit similar performance for single and concurrent writes, the differences become pronounced in query-heavy workloads. Atomic2 completes queries in just 2028 ns/op, an order of magnitude faster than the Original (28073 ns/op) and Atomic (28177 ns/op) versions. Furthermore, Atomic2 allocates significantly less memory (1743 B/op vs. over 22000 B/op) and requires only a single allocation per operation, compared to four for the other implementations.

### Mixed Workloads

In mixed workload scenarios, which combine both read and write operations, Atomic2 maintains its substantial lead, completing operations in 374.9 ns/op—nearly seven times faster than the Atomic implementation and over ten times faster than the Original. Memory usage and allocation counts are also markedly lower with Atomic2.

## Key Insights

- **Performance Parity in Single-Write Scenarios:** The optimizations to Atomic2 have eliminated any previous performance penalty, bringing it on par with the Original and Atomic implementations.
- **Superior Scalability:** Atomic2 demonstrates exceptional performance under concurrent operations, making it the optimal choice for high-concurrency environments.
- **Query Efficiency:** The Atomic2 implementation remains significantly faster and more memory-efficient for query operations, delivering a substantial reduction in both execution time and resource consumption.
- **Overall Efficiency:** Across all tested scenarios, Atomic2 consistently uses less memory and requires fewer allocations, reducing the workload on the garbage collector and improving overall system responsiveness.
